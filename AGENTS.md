- The phrase "Generated by an LLM" must be placed at the very end of every commit message, not at the beginning.
- DO NOT use HTML/web escape sequences like `&#10;` or `&quot;` in commit messages. Use proper literal newlines or standard shell escapes when committing via command line.
- Changes should pass all tests as well as be `go fix`, `go vet`, and `go fmt` compliant.
